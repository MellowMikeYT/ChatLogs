[2:01 AM] MellowMike: Regarding BCDPSRP member,  The VPS payment is due soon. And here's the deal.. Mike and I don't want to pay out of our pockets unless there is roleplay going on. We work tirelessly for this server, and no one ever gets on. We are grateful for the few who do show up and want to get roleplay going. But It's a group effort. If you want the server to stay up, come on this weekend and show you want it. If there is little to no roleplay, this will be the end of the server. We need an advertisement team to help this server grow. to get active members. But those of you who said you will be active, live up to that. You have to have integrity. Do what you say you will. Those of you who signed your name saying you wont double clan, don't double clan.. If you think we don't check, you're wrong. we do. We're not asking much of you here. Just do what you joined this community to do. Roleplay. This community cant just run and Mike and I. We need your help. Its a group effort

[2:42 PM] Kenneth Gibbs: So i wanna help just give me an role i bet you i can get us up and back running
[3:29 PM] MellowMike: What role? We do not give out director roles as 2 are enough (We are both here to watch out and make sure we arent being power hungry and doing what we need to do), We dont do admin/staff roles because its caused issues in the past, so the only roles are department and "advertisement team member" roles. Everything must be worked for before you receive it
